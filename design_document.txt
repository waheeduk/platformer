Have basic outline of game DONE
Need to mirror animation images so sprite faces left and right DONE
Need to create dash mechanic DONE
Need to create wall jump mechanic 
Need to create enemies DONE
Need to create ability gems, which once collected allow for one use of ability DONE
Need to create enemy projectiles DONE
Need to create health system PARTIAL, 
Need to create character selection
Need to create objectives and collectibes
Need to create timer and high score
Need to create swim mechanic as bonus
Need to refactor code

bugs:
wall jumps are not working
code it so player cannot go over/behind wall, code this in without physics engine

if playersprite.left hits scalable.left or scalable.right:
player.spritechangex = -dash seed or dash speed
use list comprehensions

phsyics engine operates as usual
perhaps inspect the physics engine
or if player sprite collides with scalable wall the jump reset is false
hearts are not properly moving across screen
hearts position needs to be moved with change_x and change_y
perhaps make the heart a sprite that moves like the player
differentt tier health for enemies
gems and enemies do not reset, i.e. if you die they're not resurrected
fix when implementing health/hearts
if hearts = 0
then for enemies in dead enemies
enemy_list.append(enemies)
different types of enemies should be under enemy class

character selection mechanic
if player sprite collides with character slection screen
then render a screen with left and right buttons displaying different characters

parry mechanic:
if dash pressed is true and if up pressed is true and if distance player centre
to enemy centre is less than 40 px
then player dash times direction key
