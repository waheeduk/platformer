Need to refactor code
Jump on enemy heads to kill them?

bugs:
player is almost invisible underwater!!
need to create visual feedback to show player taking damage/dying
wall jumps are not working
code it so player cannot go over/behind wall, code this in without physics engine
hearts are not properly moving across screen
hearts position needs to be moved with change_x and change_y
perhaps make the heart a sprite that moves like the player
different tier health for enemies
gems and enemies do not reset, i.e. if you die they're not resurrected
fix when implementing health/hearts
if hearts = 0
then for enemies in dead enemies
enemy_list.append(enemies)
different types of enemies should be under enemy class

character selection mechanic
if player sprite collides with character slection screen
then render a screen with left and right buttons displaying different characters

parry mechanic:
if dash pressed is true and if up pressed is true and if distance player centre
to enemy centre is less than 40 px
then player dash times direction key
