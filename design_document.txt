Have basic outline of game DONE
Need to mirror animation images so sprite faces left and right DONE
Need to create dash mechanic DONE
Need to create parry mechanic 
Need to create enemies DONE

Need to create enemy projectiles DONE
Need to create health system
Need to create character selection
Need to create objectives and collectibes
Need to create timer and high score
Need to create swim mechanic as bonus
Need to refactor code

bugs:
projectile enemies need to be vulnerable
differentt tier health for enemies
gems and enemies do not reset, i.e. if you die they're not resurrected
fix when implementing health/hearts
if hearts = 0
then for enemies in dead enemies
enemy_list.append(enemies)
different types of enemies should be under enemy class

parry mechanic:
if dash pressed is true and if up pressed is true and if distance player centre
to enemy centre is less than 40 px
then player dash times direction key
